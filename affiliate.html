            <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated: November 2025</strong></p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Important Disclosure:</strong> GoGold is a participant in the Amazon Associates Program and other affiliate marketing programs. We earn commissions from qualifying purchases made through our affiliate links.
            </div>

            <h2>1. What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
            <p>Affiliate links are special URLs that track when you click through from our website to a retailer's website. If you make a purchase after clicking an affiliate link, we receive a commission from the retailer. This commission is paid by the retailer, not by you.</p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
            <p>GoGold uses affiliate links to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide personalized product recommendations</li>
                <li>Direct you to the best prices for metal detectors</li>
                <li>Support the continued development and maintenance of our website</li>
                <li>Provide free tools and resources to our users</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Which Products Have Affiliate Links?</h2>
            <p>All product recommendations on GoGold include affiliate links to Amazon. When you click "View on Amazon" or similar buttons, you are clicking an affiliate link. These links are clearly marked and disclosed.</p>

            <h2>4. Does This Affect Your Price?</h2>
            <p><strong>No.</strong> The price you pay is exactly the same whether you click our affiliate link or go directly to Amazon. You do not pay any extra commission or fee. In fact, you may benefit from Amazon Prime shipping and other benefits.</p>

            <h2>5. Our Recommendation Process</h2>
            <p>Our recommendations are based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Product quality and performance</li>
                <li>Customer reviews and ratings</li>
                <li>Value for money</li>
                <li>Suitability for different experience levels</li>
                <li>Detection depth and specifications</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We do <strong>not</strong> recommend products solely because they have higher commission rates. Our primary goal is to help you find the best detector for your needs.</p>

            <h2>6. Affiliate Programs We Participate In</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amazon Associates Program</strong> - We earn commissions from qualifying Amazon purchases</li>
                <li><strong>YouTube</strong> - We embed educational videos and may earn revenue from embedded content</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Transparency and Honesty</h2>
            <p>We are committed to complete transparency about our affiliate relationships. Every product recommendation clearly states it is an affiliate link. We will never recommend a product we don't believe in just to earn a commission.</p>

            <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Know that we earn commissions from affiliate links</li>
                <li>Purchase directly from retailers without using our links</li>
                <li>Contact us with questions about our affiliate relationships</li>
                <li>Request information about specific products or links</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. FTC Compliance</h2>
            <p>GoGold complies with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines regarding affiliate marketing. We clearly disclose our affiliate relationships and the fact that we earn commissions from purchases made through our links.</p>

            <h2>10. Changes to This Disclosure</h2>
            <p>We may update this Affiliate Disclosure as our affiliate relationships change. We will notify you of significant changes by updating this page with a new "Last Updated" date.</p>

            <h2>11. Questions About Affiliate Links?</h2>
            <p>If you have questions about our affiliate relationships or want more information about a specific product, please contact us at: <strong>affiliate@gogold.com</strong></p>

            <h2>12. Our Commitment</h2>
            <p>Our commitment is to provide you with honest, accurate, and helpful recommendations to find the perfect metal detector for your needs. Affiliate commissions help us continue providing this service for free, but they never influence our recommendations or honesty.</p>
